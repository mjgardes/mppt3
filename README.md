Software and hardware designs for DC-DC power conversion with max power point tracking and lots of other cool features for PV applications.

Software runs on a Beaglebone Black.  The goal is to have up to three analog boards stack on top of that.  Although the way I'm driving the boards now, I could go up to eight. Maybe eleven if I figure out how to build kernel modules.  Each analog module would be optimizing one panel to eke out every last possible mW.

My goal was to have this somewhat working by July '14.

If you have suggestions or feature requests or whatever, I'm all ears.  Or even if you find a product out there that does this better.
